### Project: **Enterprise Order API** · `github.com/yourusername/order-api`
**Problem:** Monolithic order system with slow reports and frequent timeouts.  
**Approach:** Rewrote core endpoints in Laravel, introduced Redis caching and background job queues, standardized API error contracts.  
**Outcome:** Report generation time down **80%**, successful throughput increase to **50k req/day**.  
**Tech:** Laravel · Redis · MySQL · Horizon · PHPUnit

### Project: **Retail Mobile App (Flutter)** · `github.com/yourusername/retail-mobile`
**Problem:** No cross-platform presence; duplicate web logic and heavy native work.  
**Approach:** Built a Flutter app sharing business logic with web via a small shared API client package.  
**Outcome:** Single codebase for iOS/Android, accelerated release cadence by **60%**.  
**Tech:** Flutter · Provider · REST API · Firebase (analytics)

### Project: **Open Source CLI Tool** · `github.com/yourusername/cli-tool`
**Problem:** Repetitive developer tasks left manual.  
**Approach:** Created a small CLI for automated scaffolding + deploy scripts. Well documented with tests.  
**Outcome:** Reduced onboarding time for new devs by half.  
**Tech:** Node.js/PHP (tool), GitHub Actions
